### Other Components 
### Which Database?
Later when we decide on a backend database, we will start adding to the different component pages of the website. We can divide up the responsibilites and create the different components of the page. \
#### Home Page 
1) Will show all the base_____Col.jsx from the various different routes.
2) Will need to create a base for the most recent FB and IG post on the Homepage.
#### Bio/About Page
1) Base added to page already
2) Gather more information for the Band to fill the page more. 
#### Shows Page
1) Base added to page already
2) Will need a formik to add shows to the page
3) Venues' Name should be a clickable link to that venue's website
4) All shows need to be in order by upcoming date.
5) eventually the base being sent to the homepage will need to be paginated with the 8 most upcoming shows
6) the Shows page will show the first 8 and all shows after the base 8
7) when the actual date passes the shows date, then the show need to be automatically deleted.
#### Music/Photos Page
1) Base for music added to page already
2) No need for a photos base in home page
3) Will combine music and photos 
4) need to switch Mucis tab in navbar to Music/Photos
5) band wants a Spotify demo player at the top of this page. it is on their previous website
#### Social Media Page
1) Band wants a page for their social medias. some people are not on social medias and they want a spot on their website where those people can follow their socail media posts.
2) I think FaceBook and Instragram will be enough
3) need to add this as a tab in the navbar 
4) need to create a base for the most recent FB and IG post on the Homepage.

### Admin section
We will also include a admin section for the band members. The admin section will be added so that the band members can make changes to their page without having to contact us for help. 
1) This section will require a login the the band members and a forms to help them change the different components on their pages.
2) we will need to add extra buttons (like add, edit and delete buttons) to almost all components that allow the band to make changes
## Themes
1) ALL .css FOR THIS PROJECT WILL GO IN THE App.css FILE.
2) Background color: Black
3) Text color: White 
4) Font Type: PT Serif  -> https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif
5) Font Size: Standard
6) Everything on the home page will be centered with margins on each side.
7) All routes in the App.jsx (except for Merch) will have a Component with a base_____Col.jsx, this base will show on both the Homepage and the respective route's page.
8) Responsive at LG size 
9) (possible Carousel for pictures)
