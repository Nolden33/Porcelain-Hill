For right now, we are working on the hard coding the HomePage only. We will put:
1) a small Bio
2) Contact info 
3) Show dates
4) and a few music videos
5) also a under construction sign below the nav bar but above the info listed above.
## In the future...
### Other Components 
Later when we decide on a backend database, we will start adding to the different component pages of the website. We can divide up the responsibilites and create the different components of the page. \

These components will be set up like the friends/jobs/techCo class project we created before.
### Admin section
We will also include a admin section for the band members. The admin section will be added so that the band members can make changes to their page without having to contact us for help. 

This section will require a login the the band members and a forms to help them change the different components on their pages.
## Themes
1) Background color: Black
2) Text color: White 
3) Font Type: PT Serif  -> https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif
4) Font Size: Standard
5) All Components on home page will be centered with margins on each side.
6) (possible Carousel for pictures)
