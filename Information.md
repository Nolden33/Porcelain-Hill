### Other Components

These components will be set up like the friends/jobs/techCo class project we created before.
### Admin section
We will also include a admin section for the band members. The admin section will be added so that the band members can make changes to their page without having to contact us for help. 

This section will require a login the the band members and a forms to help them change the different components on their pages.
